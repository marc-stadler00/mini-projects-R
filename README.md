These mini projects were developed by myself as part of a seminar at UZH for my master studies in Political Science (Political Data Journalism).

There are two mini projects in this repository, both in the same script. The first one is a demonstration of classes using OOP and SQL. The second one is on the benefits of parallel and efficient code where I find ways to make previous code I wrote more efficient.

The repository includes the R-Quarto file with all the code as well as a PDF with the outputs and results of the script. The data used for the second mini project is not provided as I retrieved it under a contract which demanded the data to be deleted after a certain time period. The data is publicly accessible though with a data contract (Selects, 2019).
