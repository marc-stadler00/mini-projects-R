There are two mini projects in this repository, both in the same R-script. The first one is a demonstration of classes using OOP and SQL. The second one is on the benefits of parallel and efficient code where I find ways to make previous code I wrote more efficient.

The project includes the R file with all the code as well as a PDF with the outputs and results of the script. The data used for the second mini project is not provided as I retrieved it under a contract which demanded the data to be deleted after a certain time period. The data is publicly accessible though with such a data contract (Selects, 2019).
